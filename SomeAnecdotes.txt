VM.forward() --> SystemState.executeNextTransition() --> SystemState.setExecThread() --> ThreadChoiceGenerator.getNextChoice()

searchFinished is writing a DS (formed during the execution) in a file
file is read in the driver storePC to store it into a data structure (where it is also printed for debugging)
This data structure is fetched and parsed and sent as a property string in the driver of symbolic execution
Can we remove the middle step of file writing and reading?

Apart from GETFIELD, PUTFIELD, GETSTATIC, PUTSTATIC, I am storing these events:
MonitorEnter, MonitorExit,
